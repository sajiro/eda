# Earth daily analytics demo

How to start the app: run the following commands in your terminal

* npm install
* npm run dev

###  Library/Tools used
* Vite
* React
* React query
* Mapbox GL
* Shadcn (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)

### Errors encountered
* Encoutered cors issue since the API is third party

### Mistakes
* Tried Shadcn for the first time. encountered issues since is unfamiliar to me(causes time to debug issues on config with Vite and Ts).
* Spend time on playing around with the API and trying out posible combinations for searching(since im not sure about the abstraction of the API)

### Needs Improvement
* UI design - did not spend time on the design itself due to time constraint.
* Loading list should use skeleton loader
* Tokens and other sensitive informations should be in .ENV file (better in server)
* Unit test - dont have enough time to add more
